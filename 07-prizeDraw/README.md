### 07 Prize Draw

To participate in a (not very random) prize draw each participant gives his/her first name. Each first name is then given a score.

Each letter has a value which is its rank in the English alphabet. A and a have rank 1, B and b rank 2 and so on.

The length of the name is then added to the sum of these ranks to give the name its score.

Return the name of the participant with the highest score.

#### Example

```
prizeDraw(['Ben', 'Zoe', 'Adam'])
  => 'Zoe'
```
