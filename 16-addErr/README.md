### 16 Add 'Err'

In English we often use "neutral vowel sounds" such as "umm", "err", "ahh" as fillers in conversations to help them run smoothly.

Bob always finds himself saying "err". In fact he adds an "err" to every single word he says that ends in a consonant! Because Bob is odd, he likes to stick to this habit even when emailing.

Bob is begging you to write a function that adds "err" to the end of every word whose last letter is a consonant (not a vowel, y counts as a consonant).

The input is a string that can contain upper and lowercase characters, and some punctuation. The solution should be returned as a string.

```
addErr('Hello!')
  => 'Hello!'
```

```
addErr('Hello, I am Bob.')
  => 'Hello, I amerr Boberr.'
```

```
addErr('THIS IS CRAZY')
  => 'THISERR ISERR CRAZYERR'
```
