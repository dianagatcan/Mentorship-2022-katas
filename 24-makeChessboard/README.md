### 24 Make a Chessboard

A grid is a perfect starting point for many games (Chess, battleships, Candy Crush!).

Making a digital chessboard I think is an interesting way of visualising how loops can work together.

Your task is to write a function that takes two integers rows and columns and returns a chessboard pattern as a two dimensional array.

### Examples

```
makeBoard(3, 3)
  => [ ['0', 'X', '0'],
       ['X', '0', 'X'],
       ['0', 'X', '0'] ]
```


```
makeBoard(3, 5)
  => [ ['0', 'X', '0', 'X', '0'],
       ['X', '0', 'X', '0', 'X'],
       ['0', 'X', '0', 'X', '0'] ]
```
