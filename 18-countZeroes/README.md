### 18 Count the Zeroes

Create an algorithm to count the number of zeros that appear between 1 and N.

I.e

There are 2 zeros from 1 to 20: 10, 20

There are 11 zeros from 1 to 100: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100


### Examples

```
countZeroes(5)
  => 0
```

```
countZeroes(10)
  => 1
```

```
countZeroes(20)
  => 2
```

```
countZeroes(100)
  => 11
```
