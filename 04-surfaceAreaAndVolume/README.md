### 04 Surface area and volume of a box

Write a function that returns the total surface area and volume of a box as an object.

The function will take as an argument an object with height, width and depth properties. You can assume all the measurements will be integers.

#### Example:

```
surfaceAreaAndVolume({
  height: 20,
  width: 10,
  depth: 10
  })

  => {surfaceArea: 1000, volume: 2000}
```
